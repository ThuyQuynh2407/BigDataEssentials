It is widely believed that people, who live in big cities, have health affected badly. From my perspective, I would lean toward such a view and will analyze it in detail in the following essay
The argument that negative atmostphere is reasonable to some extent. First of all, there are numerous buildings constructed in big city which have developed economices. Moreover, People work and live in these building must be depend on air condition. By relying on air condition, the outside air temperature increase significantly. For instance, Hanoi, which is the capital of VietNam, has the highest percentage pollution in all the cities of VietNam. People living in that cities have routine of doing exercises in every morning. However, they share to the journalist that they must wear mask while they work out. As the result, living under polluted air leads to copicous lung-related diseases.

For example, in HoChiMinh city, there are so many music stages, bars or restaurents opening overnight. Therefore, many peole living near center such as the old do not have sleepy quanity. Consequently, people have numerous stress and increase depression in lifestyle. By the other hand, living in big cities give people more and more morden health-care services.
In conclusion, while there are benefits for living in big cities are many utilities, I still believed that it is more disadvantagous to work and live in that
The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows across the fields. It was the golden hour, that magical time when everything seems bathed in a warm, honeyed light. Sarah sat on the porch of her farmhouse, sipping a cup of tea as she watched the world go by. The air was filled with the sound of birdsong, punctuated by the occasional rustle of leaves in the gentle breeze.
As she sat there, Sarah couldn't help but reflect on the beauty of the world around her. The rolling hills, the verdant fields, the endless expanse of sky stretching out above her - it was all so breathtakingly beautiful. She felt a deep sense of gratitude wash over her, grateful for the simple joys of life.
But beneath the surface beauty, Sarah knew that life on the farm could be hard. There were long days of hard work, battling against the elements and the unpredictability of nature. Yet, despite the challenges, there was a deep sense of satisfaction that came from working the land, from seeing the fruits of her labor grow and thrive.
As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of pink and gold, Sarah felt a profound sense of peace settle over her. In that moment, she knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be - surrounded by the beauty of the natural world, and filled with a sense of contentment that could only come from living a life in harmony with it.
In the heart of the ancient forest, where sunlight filters through the dense canopy of leaves, lies a world untouched by time. Here, amidst the towering trees and the chorus of birdcalls, one can feel the pulse of nature, strong and steady as the earth itself.
It is a place of magic and mystery, where every tree tells a story and every stream whispers secrets of the past. Moss-covered stones stand as silent sentinels, bearing witness to the passage of centuries. And in the dappled shade, ferns unfurl their delicate fronds, reaching towards the light that filters through the green canopy above.
For generations, the forest has been a sanctuary for those who seek solace in its embrace. Wanderers and dreamers, poets and painters, all have found inspiration in its quiet depths. Here, time seems to stand still, and the cares of the world fade away into insignificance.
But the forest is not without its dangers. Hidden among the trees are creatures of legend and myth, guardians of the ancient woods. They move with stealth and grace, their presence felt rather than seen. And though they may seem fearsome to those who do not know them, they are protectors of the forest, ensuring that its delicate balance is maintained.
As the sun sets and darkness falls, the forest comes alive with the sounds of the night. Owls hoot in the treetops, and small creatures scurry through the underbrush. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, and the sky above is alive with stars.
In this enchanted realm, time loses all meaning. Here, in the heart of the ancient forest, one can find peace and tranquility, and a connection to something greater than themselves. For in the stillness of the woods, one can hear the whispers of the past and the promise of the future, carried on the wind through the branches of the trees
